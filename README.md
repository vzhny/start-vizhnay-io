# start.vizhnay.io

A simple React powered start page, utilizing local storage to save and display the user's saved links.

Simply set as your home page (I use [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna) Chrome extension) and begin adding links!

### To-do List

- Add a back end to save user links across devices.
- Add a theme switcher to switch between light and dark (potentially automatically reading time of day).
- Add a side menu and move always visible delete link buttons to a global setting.
